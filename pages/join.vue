    <h2>SAFER SPACE</h2>
    <p>
      We're exhilarated by the ever-growing Lightspeed energy you spread each run! Since we are so many, it's crucial to ensure that our runs create a positive, respectful, and safe environment for everyone. Juoksut is for everyone, regardless of your background.
    </p>
    <p>
      We have established the following guidelines to ensure that everyone feels safe. It is absolutely essential that these guidelines are followed!
    </p>

      <p>
        <strong>BE CONSIDERATE AND RESPECTFUL</strong>
        <br>
        We come from various backgrounds and may view things differently. Let's embrace this diversity by treating each other with kindness and understanding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>AVOID MAKING ASSUMPTIONS</strong>
        <br>
        Do not make assumptions about others' gender, sexual orientation, health, background, running abilities, or pace. If unsure, ask.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>DISCRIMINATION HAS NO PLACE AT JUOKSUT</strong>
        <br>
        Racism, sexism, or any form of discrimination is not tolerated.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RESPECT PERSONAL BOUNDARIES</strong>
        <br>
        Everyone has the right to feel safe and comfortable. Be mindful of others' personal space and boundaries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>ADDRESS INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR CONSTRUCTIVELY</strong>
        <br>
        If you notice inappropriate behavior, please inform us immediately. If you choose to discuss it privately, do so with careâ€”avoid embarrassing or mocking.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES</strong>
        <br>
        What matters is acknowledging them, apologizing, and learning from the mistakes.
